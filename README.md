# FunkPHPðŸ˜ŽðŸ•ºðŸŽ¶ðŸŒˆ - The 99 % Funktion-based PHP Framework by WebbKodsFrilansaren at GitHub

- This is a ~99 % function-based PHP framework meaning there are almost no classes used besides using objects for accessing some data because that is more convenient at some times.

- Previously, it was called "RDP" ("Route, Data, Page") and is just another way to say "Model, View, Controller" (MVC) but the idea is the procedural logic here:

  - We start with a Route (R; what to access, who can access, when and so forth).
  - Then we move on to the data (D) that may or may not be accessible within that route.
  - Finally we either return just some data and/or a page (P).
  - Rinse and repeat for each HTTPS request!

- The purpose of this PHP Framework is more to demonstrate systematic coding skills. It may or it may not be as performant as class-based PHP frameworks out there. Only time will tell.
